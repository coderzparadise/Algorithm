# Q1: Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k
# input: 1-d array of int's called 'nums' and integer k
# output: integer, the longest subarray that equals to k in nums 


# 
# Q2: Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
# input: string 's' of letters and integer k determing how many distinct letters we can have at a time
# output: integer of the max length substring possible with k distict letters


#
# Q3: subarray sum equals k
# input: 1-d array of int's and 'k' the integer sum goal
# output: return integer of the total amount of continious subarrays that equal to k


# 
# Q4: Sliding Window Maximum
# input: 1-d array of integers and integer 'k' that is the size of the window
